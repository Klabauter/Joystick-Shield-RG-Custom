# Joystick Shield RG Custom
Joystick shield for Arduino Pro Micro with shift registers, i2c text LCD and ws2812 led support.
RG Custom PCB  shield allows you to easy create your own control panel, throttle or joystick device. 

Arduino IDE 1.6.6 (or above) library that adds a joystick to the list of HID devices an Arduino Leonardo or Arduino Micro (or any Arduino clone that is based on the ATmega32u4) can support. This will not work with Arduino IDE 1.6.5 (or below).

## You will need to install 3 additional libraries:
